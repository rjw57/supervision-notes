Some notes from supervising
===========================

I have supervised a number of courses in the Department of Engineering in the
University of Cambridge. Often I find that students have similar misconceptions
or problems and at the end of a course I attempt to write some notes on the
most common problem areas.

In general these notes are somewhat rough and ready but it struck me that
having them available online may be of use to some other people.

Building
========

All of the notes have been written in LaTeX. Any modern LaTeX distribution,
such as TeXLive, should be able to build them. In addition the probability
notes require ``gnuplot`` to be installed.

Disclaimer and license
======================

All of these notes are placed into the public domain. I make no warranty as to
their completeness or their correctness. If you find these notes useful, I
would be interested to hear from you. My email address is ``rjw57@cantab.net``.

Similarly, any corrections or clarifications would be much appreciated.
